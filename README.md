Social Media  & Eating Disorders: Measured through Sentiment and Correlation Analysis

Background:

Eating disorders is defined as a disease that impacts both the mental and physical human aspect of those suffering and there are several different types of eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia and orthorexia.  Within the United States alone, there are over thirty (30) million Americans who suffer from an eating disorder, which encompasses twenty (20) million females and ten (10) million males (Valex, 2021). 

Research:

Through sentiment analysis, I wanted to get a sense on feelings around eating disorder social media tweets, as my initial bias is that it is negative.  Additionally, looking into any possible correlation between negative tweet sentiment and those who have over 1 million followers.  From there, and on the second dataset, looking at global prevalence to visually display how large of a problem this is.  I utilized two different data sets from Kaggle around eating disorders. My bias, based on my own journey/experience, and perception of social media impacts on those with eating disorders, is that a majority of social media tweets will be negative, especially with those who have over 1 million followers.  Additional bias includes that prevalence rates are continuing to increase and that there is a correlation between negative tweet sentiment and increasing prevalence rates. Below are the 

Research Hypotheses:

H0: There is no significant correlation between users with over five thousand followers and negative tweet sentiment

H0: There is no significant correlation between users with over five thousand and positive tweet sentiment

H0: There is no significant correlation between 2009-2013 total prevalence population (United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil) and negative and neutral tweet sentiment

H0: There is no significant correlation between 2009-2013 total prevalence population (Russia, Nigeria, India, China) and negative and neutral tweet sentiment.
